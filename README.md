## 📝 Daily Activity Log

### Week 1

<details open>
<summary><b>Day 1 - December 29, 2025</b> ✅ COMPLETED - EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS!</summary>

**📚 Topics Covered:**
- Variables and all primitive data types (int, double, float, char, boolean, String)
- Arithmetic operations and type casting
- Conditional statements (if-else, nested if, else-if, ternary operator)
- Switch-case statements
- All loop types (for, while, do-while, nested loops, for-each)
- Arrays (1D) - declaration, initialization, iteration, algorithms
- String methods (15+ methods: charAt, substring, length, contains, etc.)
- Math class methods and random number generation
- Scanner input and validation techniques
- Break and Continue statements

**💻 Programs Written:** (20 programs total!)

**Variables & Basics:**
1. `VariablesPractice.java` - All primitive data types
2. `ArithmeticOperations.java` - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
3. `AreaOfTriangle.java` - Formula application with floats
4. `AsciiValue.java` - Type casting demonstration

**Input & Output:**
5. `PrintNumberTakenByUser.java` - Scanner basics
6. `MultiplyTwoNumbers.java` - User input with calculations

**Conditional Statements:**
7. `CheckNumPositiveOrNot.java` - If-else with validation
8. `CheckAgeforVote.java` - Complex validation + ternary operator
9. `NestedIfDemo.java` - Nested if with multiple conditions
10. `SwitchCaseDemo.java` - Switch-case for day names

**Loops:**
11. `LoopsPractice.java` - All loops + countdown timer + dice game!
12. `PrintEvenValueForLoop.java` - For loop + sum calculation
13. `NestedForLoop.java` - Nested loops for multiplication table
14. `FactorialDemo.java` - Factorial algorithm
15. `BreakContinueFlow.java` - Break and continue demonstration

**Arrays:**
16. `ArrayDemo.java` - Array declaration, initialization, iteration
17. `ArrayAvgAge.java` - Array sum and average calculation
18. `ArrayLowestAge.java` - Finding minimum in array

**Strings & Math:**
19. `StringPractice.java` - 15+ String methods explored
20. `MathClass.java` - Math methods + creative OTP generator!

**✨ Key Learnings:**
- Mastered all basic Java syntax and control structures
- Understood the Scanner buffer issue (nextInt() → nextLine())
- Learned proper resource management (closing Scanner)
- Created algorithms for array operations (min, max, sum, average)
- Explored String manipulation extensively
- Built creative programs beyond basic requirements

**🔧 Challenges Faced:**
- **Scanner buffer issue:** When using `nextInt()` followed by `nextLine()`, the newline character remains in buffer. Solved by adding extra `sc.nextLine()` to clear buffer.
- **Array index confusion:** Initially made mistakes with 0-based indexing. Practiced until it became natural.
- **Type casting:** Had to remember to cast to `(double)` for accurate division results.
- **Resource management:** Learned importance of closing Scanner with `sc.close()` to prevent resource leaks.

**💡 Creative Highlights:**
- **OTP Generator:** Built a random 6-digit OTP generator using `Math.random()` and String manipulation
- **Countdown Timer:** Created New Year countdown with `Thread.sleep()`
- **Dice Roller:** Made interactive dice game with star visualization
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Added input validation in multiple programs to handle edge cases

**⏱️ Time Spent:** 3.5 hours (went beyond planned 2 hours due to enthusiasm!)  

**😊 Mood:** Extremely motivated! Realized I can do more than expected! 💪🔥
